# SKA Prime Numbers: Real-Time Learning of the Prime Sequence

This project explores a radically new approach to understanding the prime numbers through the lens of **Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)**—a forward-only, entropy-driven learning framework.

Unlike traditional number theory, which analyzes prime properties in a static or retrospective manner, this repository initiates a **real-time learning process** over the sequence of primes, with the goal of uncovering **hidden dynamics**, **regime transitions**, and **information structures** encoded in their progression.

##  Objectives

- Develop **real-time learning algorithms** to track evolving information in the prime number sequence.
- Define **novel features** on primes for SKA processing:

  1. **Percentage gap changes:**

    $$
    \Large \frac{P_{k+1} - P_k}{P_k}
    $$

  2. **Oscillatory function:**

$$
\Large f(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \cos\left( \sum_{j=1}^{k} \frac{P_{j+1} - P_j}{P_j} \right)
$$



- Compare SKA learning trajectories over different feature representations.
- Examine **entropy evolution** and **alignment metrics** for uncovering latent order or geometric resonance in prime distributions.

Here is a polished version of your `README.md` file for the repository **SKA Prime Numbers**, including a `Structure` section placeholder and a touch of formatting refinement to enhance readability:

# SKA Prime Numbers: Real-Time Learning of the Prime Sequence

This project explores a radically new approach to understanding prime numbers through the lens of **Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)**—a forward-only, entropy-driven learning framework.

Unlike traditional number theory, which analyzes prime properties in a static or retrospective manner, this repository initiates a **real-time learning process** over the sequence of primes, aiming to uncover **hidden dynamics**, **regime transitions**, and **information structures** encoded in their progression.





##  Why This Is Surprising

Prime gaps are famously irregular. However, by applying SKA and constructing transforms such as $f(n)$, we begin to see **bounded, wave-like patterns** emerge.

This suggests that what appears to be randomness may conceal **hidden phase regularities**—challenging classical assumptions and opening new interdisciplinary pathways between number theory, signal processing, and information geometry.



##  Structure (Initial)




## Next Steps

* [ ] Compute the defined features over an initial range of primes
* [ ] Launch real-time SKA learning on both features
* [ ] Add live visualizations of entropy and cosine evolution
* [ ] Explore **phase portraits** and **Fourier projections** of $f(n)$
